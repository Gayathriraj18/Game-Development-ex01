# AIM:

To Implement various effects in a material such as emissive, roughness, and metallic properties in Unreal Engine.

# PROCEDURE:
# Step1 :
Right-click in the content browser and choose material. Rename the material and double-click to open it

# Step2 :
Right-click in the working space and search for constants. In constant choose constant vector

# Step3 :
After this double click on the constant vector 4 and edit the colour using the colour picker.

# Step4 :
After adjusting the colour click okay and save it.

# Step5 :
They join the output of the constant vector 4 to the base colour.

# Step6 :
Create a single constant using step 3 and adjust its value of it using detail panel by adjusting the value.

# Step7 :
And you can apply this constant value to metallic, roughness, emissive colour etc..

# Step8 :
For emissive you need to multiply the constant vector 4 and constant and apply it to emissive colour.

# Step9 :
For creating walls and gate you need to create a material and import a png image.

# Step10 :
And use the png image as texture sample and connect the (rgb) of texture sample to the emissive colour & connect the alpha value of texture sample to the opacity.

# Step11 :
The save it, go to the third person example map and create a plane or cube apply the material which you have created for the wall or gate.

Output :

# Normal Colour:
